					The Trump "victory" is a massive loss for the right as a whole (including trump himself) and a massive win for the global left. Those who know the Austrian Business Cycle Theory, may be aware of this, but regardless, I just hope that this prophecy of mine is incorrect, notwithstanding that
					its first part already came true with the victory of Donald Trump, which I had predicted at least months before (and admittedly it wasn't hard to predict).
the way the democrat's campaign was handled was simply disastrous from the choice of biden, to the choice of kamala, and everything afterwards. I posit that this wasn't just the result of incompetence, but part of an intended result by those who manage the strategic horizon of meaning (just like in businesses).
The economy has been expanding for decades as a result of inflationary policy, which still even carries the remnants of 2008. it is thus the logical consequence that a recession has to happen for the economy to adjust.
Those who are in control will make sure that the money-printing machine will cease to operate under mid/late trump presidency, and rates increased (which by the way will finally curb the inflation, symptom of the bubble reaching unsustainable size), thus leading to the adjustment period, i.e. the depression.
					this depression will be remembered as a great failure of the trump administration who has now become the representative of the right as a whole given the increasing polarization.
					the trump's policy may lead the a speedier recovery from the depression, but their fruits will likely be harvested by the following administration, which, given the great depression under trump, will likely be democrat run.
					this will result in a massive blow to the credibility of right wing economic policy, as well as a boost of left wing economic policy's legitimacy, and they will ensure that the right scapegoat will take the blame for what was inevitably to come.

					As soon as mature members of society habitually express acceptance or even advocate egalitarian sentiments, whether in the form of
democracy (majority rule) or of communism, it becomes essential that
other members, and in particular the natural social elites, be prepared to
act decisively and, in the case of continued nonconformity, exclude and
ultimately expel these members from society. In a covenant concluded
among proprietor and community tenants for the purpose of protecting
their private property, no such thing as a right to free (unlimited) speech
exists, not even to unlimited speech on one's own tenant-property. One
may say innumerable things and promote almost any idea under the
sun, but naturally no one is permitted to advocate ideas contrary to the
very purpose of the covenant of preserving and protecting private property, such as democracy and communism. There can be no tolerance
toward democrats and communists in a libertarian social order. They
will have to be physically separated and expelled from society.

                  		The state, the monopoly on violence, functions no differently from a protection rackets. It brands all
                  		competing efforts as criminal or it subordinates them to its will. Production under such a monopolistic
                  		environment happens only within the boundaries placed by the monopoly of violence. It is shown that ownership of the 
                  		means of production is not clearly of the capitalistic class but much more of the government elites. Those producers
                  		that comply with the state regulations and live in a symbiotic relationship with the monopoly of violence cannot
                  		be considered capitalists in the pure sense of the word anymore. We thus incour in Conservative Socialism, i.e. the
                  		preservation of the means of production in the hands of a state approved circle of quasi-state employees. The cooperation
                  		of these two classes transforms them into a singular enemy of the advocates of private property as their joint efforts
                  		infringe upon the private property rights of others.
