                  The state, the monopoly on violence, functions no differently from a protection rackets. It brands all
                  competing efforts as criminal or it subordinates them to its will. Production under such a monopolistic
                  environment happens only within the boundaries placed by the monopoly of violence. It is shown that ownership of the 
                  means of production is not clearly of the capitalistic class but much more of the government elites. Those producers
                  that comply with the state regulations and live in a symbiotic relationship with the monopoly of violence cannot
                  be considered capitalists in the pure sense of the word anymore. We thus incour in Conservative Socialism, i.e. the
                  preservation of the means of production in the hands of a state approved circle of quasi-state employees. The cooperation
                  of these two classes transforms them into a singular enemy of the advocates of private property as their joint efforts
                  infringe upon the private property rights of others.
